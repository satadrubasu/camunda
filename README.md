Design Components :
 MODELER ( DESKTOP CLIENT)
 AUTOMATE ( Workflow Engine + DEcisino Engine + Tasklist + Cockpit)
 IMPROVE ( OPTIMIZE )
JAVA / REST APIs across all above components 


Choice for choosing :  
 Not tools that automate in isolation , but something which has modernized integration and end-to-end
1.  Orchestrate every human and automation task in and end to end fashion.
  END to End = systems + APIS + microservices + IOT devices , AI/ML Tools.
2. Support for long-running processes.
3. Provide analytics that can be actionable.
   (Realtime and historic data)
4. Use Open standards to facilitate alignment between business and IT.
